    By default, booleanOperations is used to remove overlaps. You can choose

    By default, it also converts all the PostScript cubic Bezier curves to
    TrueType quadratic splines. If the outlines are already quadratic, you
    can skip this by setting ``convertCubics`` to False.

    The optional ``conversionError`` argument controls the tolerance
    of the approximation algorithm. It is measured as the maximum distance
    between the original and converted curve, and it's relative to the UPM
    of the font (default: 1/1000 or 0.001).

    When converting curves to quadratic, it is assumed that the contours'
    winding direction is set following the PostScript counter-clockwise
    convention. Thus, by default the direction is reversed, in order to
    conform to opposite clockwise convention for TrueType outlines.
    You can disable this by setting ``reverseDirection`` to False.

    If both ``inplace`` and ``rememberCurveType`` options are True, the curve
    type "quadratic" is saved in font' lib under a private cu2qu key; the
    preprocessor will not try to convert them again if the curve type is
    already set to "quadratic".
