    between the original and converted curve, and it's relative to the UPM
    of the font (default: 1/1000 or 0.001).

    When converting curves to quadratic, it is assumed that the contours'
    winding direction is set following the PostScript counter-clockwise
    convention. Thus, by default the direction is reversed, in order to
    conform to opposite clockwise convention for TrueType outlines.
